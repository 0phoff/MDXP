# Getting Started
Before getting started, make sure you have NPM and Node installed.

## TLDR
```bash
# Initialize presentation project
npm init @mdxp/webpack -g my_presentation
cd my_presentation

# Start dev server
npm run start

# Edit presentation with your favourite editor
vim src/presentation.mdx

# Build presentation
npm run build
```


## Recommended
The easiest way to get started with MDXP, is to use our Webpack template.
To use it, just run the following command:

```bash
# NPM >= 6.1.0
npm init @mdxp/webpack -g name
cd name

# NPM >= 5.2.0
npx @mdxp/create-webpack -g name
cd name
```

> __NOTE__  
> The `-g` flag enables the initialisation of a git repository. Remove that flag if you do not want a repository.

This command will create a project with your chosen name.
The project will contain a _src_ directory for your source files and a _dist_ directory where the resulting build will go.
The _src_ directory already contains a _presentation.mdx_ file, which you can edit to start writing your presentation right away.
Of course, nothing stops your from also modifying the _index.html_ or _index.jsx_ files to your liking.

The project also comes with a few commands to create your presentation:

- `npm run start` sets up a development server which will rebuild your presentation whenever you make changes.
- `npm run build:web` will create a build from your presentation, which is optimised for serving online. The resulting build can be found in _dist/web_.
- `npm run build:onepage` will create a build which is optimised for presenting. Most data will be consolidated into a single _index.html_, with only large images, videos or other data files added separately. You can find this build in the _dist/onepage_ folder and should be able to run your presentation in any (modern) browser by just opening the _index.html_ file.
- `npm run build` creates both web and onepage versions of your presentation with a single command.
- `npm run clean:web`, `npm run clean:onepage` and `npm run clean` respectively clean your _dist/web_, _dist/onepage_ or both folders.

If you need to modify or extend the Webpack build pipeline, you can do so by editing the _webpack.config.js_ or _webpack.onepage.js_ files, in order to modify the web or onepage builds.

## Manual
At the end of the day, MDXP is just a react library, so you can get it working with any bundler of your liking.
While we do recommend to use our Webpack template, some people might prefer to setup their own build pipeline.
A complete and thorough guide on how to create your own build pipeline is neigh impossible, but here are some guidelines on what you need to get working:

- Include `react`, `react-dom`, `theme-ui` and `@mdxp/core` packages. You will probably also want the `@mdxp/components` package.
- Process JSX into JavaScript (technically not necessary, but who writes React in pure JavaScript?).
- Transform MDX into JavaScript. This is necessary as you will write your presentation in that format. Optionally, you can add the plugins from `@mdxp/rehypex-plugins` or others to enhance your markdown syntax.
- Handle assets (eg. images) somehow. You can place them into a separate folder or have your bundler process them.
- You need to insert a `Deck` component from `@mdxp/core`, which contains your presentation. Below is a minimal example, written as JSX.

```jsx
// Note that the main index.html includes this file and has a div with an ID of 'root'
// If you do not want @mdxp/components, you can remove the import and the 'components' property from <Deck />
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Deck from '@mdxp/core';
import components from '@mdxp/components';
import MDXPresentation from './presentation.mdx';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Deck components={components}>
    <MDXPresentation />
  </Deck>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

> __NOTE__  
> Note that all examples and guides on this website assume you use the template.
