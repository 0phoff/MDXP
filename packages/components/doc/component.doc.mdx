# Components
This page contains the documentation for all regular Components that the `@mdxp/components` package has to offer.

---


## AutoStepper
This component does not render anything, but can be used to automatically step through your slide.
It is best used as a direct child of your slide and should not be nested inside other components.

> __NOTE__  
> By setting the `end` value to 0, you will automatically step through your deck until you reach the next slide.

### Properties
<Arguments>
{{
  name: 'start',
  type: 'number',
  desc: 'Fist stepIndex for the AutoStepper.',
  default: '0'
}}
{{
  name: 'end',
  type: 'number',
  desc: 'Last stepIndex for the AutoStepper. If you pass 0 or a negative number, it starts to count from the end.',
  default: '-1'
}}
{{
  name: 'time',
  type: 'number',
  desc: 'Time in milliseconds it should wait before automatically stepping.',
  default: '1000'
}}
</Arguments>

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

<Step>

- Step through the slide to show this first bullet point
- Afterwards, this slide will automatically step through the remaining bullet points
- Every 1500ms a new bullet shows
- item 4
- item 5

</Step>
<AutoStepper start={1} time={1500} />

```

## Block
This component will suround its children with an element, which you can style with theme-aware properties.  
Besides that, it also allows to set any of the CSS properties for children of either 'flex' or 'grid' layouts, by setting it as a property of the component, instead of setting it through the `sx` property.
This allows it to be more easily used in conjunction with the [Flex](#flex) and [Grid](#grid) components.

> __NOTE__  
> You can also set the CSS width and height of this component through properties on the object.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Block} />

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

<Block width="50%" sx={{bg: 'accent'}}>

This block will take 50% of the surrounding width and have a background color set to the theme accent color.

Blocks can obviously contain multiple elements and by default group them in a div.
This component is quite handy in conjunction with columns.

</Block>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Block as="em" sx={{color: 'red'}}>

Here the surrounding element will be an `em` tag.  
You can also pass custom components, but beware that you need to put them in between braces instead of quotes : {Component}

</Block>

```

---


## Flex
This element is a [Block](#block) component, but it has its display property set to 'flex' by default and allows to set any flex-related CSS properties as values on the item itself, without needing to wrap it in an `sx` prop.

> __NOTE__  
> If you do not know what `display: flex` does, it is highly recommended to read [this flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox).
> Flexbox is a super handy tool to quickly create one-dimensional layouts and control how your elements are placed.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Flex} />

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

<Flex justifyContent="space-around" alignItems="center" height="100%">

<Block sx={{bg: 'red'}} height="50px" flexGrow="1" />
<Block sx={{bg: 'tomato'}} flexGrow="2">

These blocks will grow to fill the space! 

</Block>
<Block sx={{bg: 'red'}} height="50px" flexGrow="1" />

</Flex>
```

---


## Grid
This element is a [Block](#block) component, but it has its display property set to 'grid' by default and allows to set any grid-related CSS properties as values on the item itself, without needing to wrap it in an `sx` prop.

> __NOTE__  
> If you do not know what `display: grid` does, it is highly recommended to read [this CSS grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid).
> Grid is the two-dimensional counterpart of the flexbox layout, but there are various other minor differences between both.
> This [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Relationship_of_Grid_Layout#Grid_and_flexbox) does a good job at comparing both layout methods.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Grid} />

### Examples
```mdxp
<Grid
  gridTemplateColumns="1fr 3fr 1fr"
  gridTemplateRows="20% auto 5%"
  gridTemplateAreas={['header header header', 'main main sidebar', '. footer .']}
  gridGap='10px'
>

<Block gridArea="header" sx={{bg: 'tomato', textAlign: 'center'}}>

## SLIDE 1

</Block>

<Block gridArea="main" sx={{bg: 'tomato'}}>

- Your main content goes here
- lovely layout

</Block>

<Block gridArea="sidebar" sx={{bg: 'tomato'}}>

Sidebar

</Block>

<Block gridArea="footer" sx={{bg: 'tomato'}}>
 
Footer 

</Block>

</Grid>

---
```

---


## Place
This component allows you to absolutely position an element in your slide, effectively taking it outside of the flow of the other elements.  
If you do pass neither _left_, nor _right_ properties, the element will be centered horizontally and similarly for _top_ and _bottom_.
Centering happens, by adding a `transform: translate()` CSS property, so beware if you pass your own transform property through _sx_.

> __NOTE__  
> This component surround its elements with a div, and it is that div that gets placed.  
> If you use this component to center eg. an image, it is thus important to set your desired width on this element,
> and set the width of the image to 100%.
> Otherwise the image will not look centered, as it is the surrounding div that is centered and not the image.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Place} />

### Example
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1
This paragraph is in the normal flow of the slide

<Place bottom="10px">

This paragraph gets placed in the bottom center.

</Place>

- This list is placed under the first paragraph
- Just like if the second paragraph was never there

---

# SLIDE 2
The image below gets placed in the center of the slide and takes 50% of the slide width.

<Place sx={{width: '50%'}}>

<!-- Note that you can use regular markdown image syntax and set the width through the alt-text -->
<img width="100%" src="public/logo.svg" />

</Place>
```

---


## Styling
This component applies any property you pass as a custom style to its child.
It applies the styles using the _sx_ property and thus allows the use of theme values.

> __NOTE__  
> This component only allows to have a single child element!

### Properties
<Arguments>
{{
  name: 'sx',
  type: 'object',
  desc: 'You can style the element by giving an sx property. This is set as a Theme-UI sx property and can thus accept theme aware values.',
  default: '{}'
}}
{{
  name: 'children',
  type: 'element',
  desc: 'Single child that gets styled according to the sx property.'
}}
</Arguments>

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

<Styling sx={{bg: 'accent', color: 'black', width: '100%', paddingLeft:'50px', listStyleType: 'square'}}>

- This list has a background color set to your theme's accent color
- The foreground color is set to black
- We also set a width and paddingLeft property.

</Styling>
