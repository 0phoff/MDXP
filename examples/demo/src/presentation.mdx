# Stepping

<Step>

With MDXP, stepping through your slide becomes a breeze.

Just wrap your content in a `Step` component and voila!

<Step>

- You can even nest step components
- This is nice, because if the step component only has one child
- like in this example it only has a UL
- Then it will step through it's children automatically!
