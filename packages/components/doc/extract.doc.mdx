# Extract Components
This page contains the documentation for all Extract Components that the `@mdxp/components` package has to offer.

---


## Head
This component allows you to set metadata of your presentation inside of your MDX file.
It uses `ReactDom.createPortal` in order to insert your tags at runtime.

> __NOTE__  
> You cannot use this component to overwrite existing tags like `<title>` if they already exist on the page, as valid HTML only allows for one such tag in the HTML head.
> If you need such behaviour, you can create your own extract component that uses eg. [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), but as it is quite a big dependency, we decided to create this "dumber" version instead.
