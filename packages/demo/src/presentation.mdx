# Testing MDX components

Does this __bold text__ work  ?  
and _italics_ as well ?

- Unordered list
- Also called Itemize in LaTeX

1. Ordered list
2. Also called Enumerate in LaTeX

<DummyLayout sx={{bg: 'salmon'}}>

# Testing custom Layouts

1. We should only see one red banner
2. This is because our custom layout has overwritten the default one (we just happen to use the same layout)
2. We changed the background color of our layout to salmon, to show we do in fact use this new layout

</DummyLayout>

# Testing Steps

<!--
  The offset adds an offset to the number of steps and is set to 1 by default.
  Setting this to zero allows to show the first element straight away.
  In this case, we could have achieved the same thing, by moving the "Paragraph 1" outside of the Step.
-->
<Step offset='0'>

Paragraph 1

1. Steps work with different kind of children
2. Like ordered lists

Paragraph 2

- Unordered lists should also work
- Because in the end, they are all just child components

</Step>

# Double Steps Inverted

<Step>

Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2

Paragraph 3

Paragraph 4 : The first Step component has the highest number of elements  
and it still works, because the stepLength did not get overwritten.  
How cool is that! (Seriously, it took me way too long to figure this one out...)

# List Steps 

<Step>

- If the Step component only has one child
- Like in this example there is only an unordered list
- Then it will step through it's children
- Instead of showing that element in one go!

</Step>

# Nested Steps

__[TODO]__ Nested steps dont work yet!
