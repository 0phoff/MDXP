# Presentation Syntax
This page explains all there is to know about the syntax you use to write presentations.


## Markdown
You write your presentation using the MDX syntax, which is a superset of Markdown.  
This means that you can use all the markup features you know and love from markdown like lists, tables, headings, italic text, bold text, etc.
In order to separate different slides, we use the "Horizontal Rule" html element, which is inserted into Markdown by entering 3 dashes `---` on a single line.
The following snippet shows 3 different slides, each with some different markup:

```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

This first slide contains an H1 heading and some paragraphs.
This paragraph contains _italic_ and __bold__ text.  
Notice that this sentence, which is part of the paragraph, is on its own line.
By ending a line with 2 spaces, you can add newline breaks inside of a paragraph.

This is a second paragraph.
Note that there is much more whitespace, than with regular newlines.

You can press the 'SHOW' button in the top right corner of this block to see a live demo of this example (not available on mobile).  
In order to step through the slides, you can use the arrow keys or you can touch the slide on the left or right hand sides.  
Alternatively, you can use SHIFT+arrows or you can swipe to move through the slides, ignoring the steps (more on that later).  
Press escape or click outside of the slide to close it.

### SLIDE 2

This second slide has an H3 tag and 2 lists

- Bullet point list
- These are often used in presentations
- But should they ?

1. Numbered lists
2. There are occasions when these are really useful

---

## SLIDE 3

| Left Align | Middle Align | Right Align |
|:-----------|:------------:|------------:|
| data       | data         | data        |
| data       | data         | data        |
| data       | data         | data        |

Note that these live demo examples have some minor issues.  
This markup gets rendered live, which sometimes causes flickering behaviour and the default theme does not get applied either.  
This can cause some minor differences between the examples you see here and how they render when you run it in a real MDXP slide deck.  
As an example, this table should have lines between the rows when the default theme is applied.
```

> __NOTE__  
> Note that it is important for the "Horizontal Rule" slide separator to have an empty line above.
> This is because markdown has an alternate syntax for H2 tags, which involves adding dashes underneath text.  
> We usually add an empty line below the separator as well, as it improves readability and clearly shows slide boundaries, but this is strictly speaking not necessary.


## Markdown Extended
If you use the starter template, we added plugins to extend the default markdown syntax and provide extra features.  
For example, we added emoji unicode support and also math support through [Katex](https://katex.org/).

> __NOTE__  
> Note that our live demo runtime does not include these extensions and thus we cannot show them working.  
> However, you can run these examples yourself and see that they are in fact working!

```md
# SLIDE 1

This slide contains emojis! :+1: :stuck_out_tongue:

---

# SLIDE 2

In order to use inline math, you surround it with dollar signs: $C_L$.  
You can also have a math block, which starts and ends with `$$`

$$
\begin{aligned}
L &= \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L \\
E &= mc^2
\end{aligned}
$$
```

We also build some plugins specifically for use with MDX.
You can find more information about each of them in the API documentation of [@mdxp/rehypex-plugins](/rehypex-autoimport),
but we will explain the main changes here.

Firstly, our plugins allow you to use videos in your presentations, just like you would images.  
It does this by looking at the file extension and if it ends in one of `[mp4,webm,avi,mpg,mpeg,wmv,ogg]` it will be considered a video instead of an image.
If your video URL does not end with one of these extensions (eg. a link to an online video), you can force our plugin to consider it as a video, by prepending your URL with `!video!`

Secondly, both images and videos can have extra properties through their "Alternate Text" fields.
Just write 2 ampersands `&&` after the alternate text and enter your properties (without whitespace).

```md
# SLIDE 1

Below this paragraph is an image, with its width set to 75%.

![my image&&width='75%'](./path/to/image.png)

---

# SLIDE 2

And now a video, automatically detected through the extension of the file

![my video](./path/to/video.mp4)

---

# SLIDE 3

This is an online video, which does not have the correct extension  
We force this to render a video by adding !video! to the url

![online video](!video!http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.flv)
```

> __NOTE__  
> You cannot link to Youtube videos like this, because Youtube does not provide the raw video data for people to download.
> In order to play a Youtube video, you need to use their specific API.
> There are plenty of React libraries that provide a component, which you can use in your slide deck.

A trained React/Webpack developer might have noticed something weird in the previous example.  
Indeed, when using Webpack you need to explicitly `import` all files you use, so that Webpack correctly processes them.
Because it is quite tiresome to do this when writing your presentation, we created a plugin that goes through all JSX tags (also images and videos), and automatically imports any property which is a file.
You can inhibit this behaviour by prepending `!noimport!` to your property string.

```md
<Component property="./path/to/valid/file.txt" />

<!-- This gets transformed automatically to: -->
import AI__path_to_valid_file_txt from './path/to/valid/file.txt'

<Component property={AI__path_to_valid_file_txt} />

---

![alt text](./path/to/image.png)

<!-- This also works for images (and videos): -->
import AI__path_to_image_png from './path/to/image.png';

![alt text]({AI__path_to_image_png})

---

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0phoff/MDXP/master/public/logo.svg)

<!-- If a property is not a valid file on your system, it does not get imported -->
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0phoff/MDXP/master/public/logo.svg)

---

<Component property="!noimport!./path/to/valid/file.txt" />

<!-- By prepending !noimport! the property does not get imported: -->
<Component property="./path/to/valid/file.txt" />
```


## MDX
Of course, Markdown can only do so much and in order to create truly dynamic slides, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allows you to seamlessly integrate React components into your Markdown files.
In the example below, we use the `Step` component from this very library, in order to step through our slide elements.

```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

<Step>

- This slide uses a Component inside of markdown
- It is this magic recipe that allow you to create magnificent presentations
- And also add dynamic behaviour to your slide

</Step>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Step useColumns={true}>

| Left Align | Middle Align | Right Align |
|:-----------|:------------:|------------:|
| data       | data         | data        |
| data       | data         | data        |
| data       | data         | data        |

</Step>
```

The example above also demonstrates some key points that are necessary to follow, in order to successfully use components with MDX:

- In order to use Markdown syntax inside of a component (or html tag), you need to surround your markdown block with empty lines.
- If you do not add these empty lines, the content is simply regarded as regular html markup.
- You should not indent your code, as indentation has a special meaning for markdown and will thus usually not result in what you want to achieve.
- Just like with React, you can pass properties to components. If your property is a string, you can simply surround it within quotes (like html), but if you want to pass other types like numbers, objects or arrays, you need to surround them with curly braces `{}`.


## Styling
Because MDX allows custom objects inside of properties, we can easily provide basic styles to html elements, by adding a `style` property.  
However, styling like that makes it rather difficult to provide a consistent look and feel throughout your presentation and thus MDXP uses the [Theme-UI][themeui] CSS-in-JS library, to allow for theme-aware styling.
By styling your components with an `sx` property instead of `style`, you can give it theme-aware values.

```mdxp
# SLIDE 1

<div style={{backgroundColor: 'tomato', width: '50%'}}>

This div got styled by passing an object as `style` element.

Note that you need to enter double braces here, because you need them to start the property and to start the object.  
We also use camelCase instead of the typical css kebab-case.

</div>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Block sx={{bg: 'accent', width: '75%', px: '20px'}}>

This is a Block component from the `@mdxp/components` package.  
It wraps the content in a div and allows us to style it with a theme-aware `sx` property.

The accent color defaults to the MDXP yellow, which is what you will see here as background.  
Note that we can use the `bg` (background) and `px` (paddingX) shorthand properties.
There are many such shorthands and we highly recommend reading the Theme-UI documentation to fully understand how it all works.

</Block>
```


Note that only custom components which were build to work with [Theme-UI][themeui] can accept `sx` themeable styling properties.
You can thus not use `sx` with regular HTML elements and need to explicitly add support for `sx` in your own custom components.
