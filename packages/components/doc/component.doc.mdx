# Components
This page contains the documentation for all regular Components that the `@mdxp/components` package has to offer.

---


## Columns
This component turns each of his children into a separate column.
You can set different styling options for the columns, by passing them as properties to this component.
If you pass an array as a property, each column will get a separate value.  
Internally, this component is implemented as a surrounding div with the following style:
```js
{
  width: '100%',
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  justifyContent: 'space-around',
  alignItems: 'center'
}
```

### Properties
<Arguments of={Columns} />

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1

<Columns>

1. This slide will have 2 columns
2. The first one with this numbered list

- And the second column will contain this list
- Which consists of bullet points

</Columns>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Columns width={['20%','50%','20%']} textAlign="center">

This slide has three columns, each with different widths.

The second column is wider.
Because `textAlign` is not an array, it gets applied to each column.

The third column is smaller again.
Note that the remaining 10% of width gets used as whitespace, depending on the justify-content parent property.
If any child has a flex-grow property, it will grow to fill those last 10%,
but you can read up on `flex` if you want to better understand this.

</Columns>
```

---


## Place
This component allows you to absolutely position an element in your slide, effectively taking it outside of the flow of the other elements.  
If you do pass neither _left_, nor _right_ properties, the element will be centered horizontally and similarly for _top_ and _bottom_.
Centering happens, by adding a `transform: translate()` CSS property, so beware if you pass your own transform property through _sx_.

> __NOTE__  
> This component surround its elements with a div, and it is that div that get's placed.  
> If you use this component to center an image, it is thus important to set your desired width on this element,
> and set the width of the image to 100%.
> Otherwise the image will not look centered, as it is the surrounding div that is centered and not the image.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Place} />

### Example
```md
# SLIDE 1
This paragraph is in the normal flow of the slide

<Place bottom="10px">

This paragraph gets placed in the bottom center.

</Place>

- This list is placed under the first paragraph
- Just like if the second paragraph was never there

---

# SLIDE 2
The image below gets placed in the center of the slide and takes 50% of the slide width.

<Place sx={{width: '50%'}}>

![image&&width=100%](./path/to/image.png)

</Place>
```

---


## Styling
This component applies any property you pass as a custom style to its child.
It applies the styles using the _sx_ property and thus allows the use of theme values.

> __NOTE__  
> This component only allows to have a single child element!

### Properties
<Arguments>
{{
  name: 'children',
  type: 'element',
  desc: 'Single child that gets styled according to the sx property.'
}}
{{
  name: 'props',
  type: 'object',
  required: false,
  desc: 'Style that gets applied to the child. This is set as a Theme-UI sx property and can thus accept theme aware values.',
}}
</Arguments>

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1

<Styling bg="accent" color="black" width="100%" paddingLeft="25px">

- This list has a background color set to your theme's accent color
- The foreground color is set to black
- We also set a width and paddingLeft property.

</Styling>
```
