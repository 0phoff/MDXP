<MDXPSideLayout showSlideNum={false} split={3}>

## Example

Let's build a React component.  
While this example only shows a very basic component,
you can use any React component you want.

MDXP also exposes a few hooks for you to use in order to get
more information about the state of the slide deck.

<Card bg='MDXPGray5'>

```jsx file=./counter-simplified.jsx

```

</Card>
</MDXPSideLayout>

<MDXPSideLayout showSlideNum={false} split={3}>

## Example

Using your components inside of your slides is super easy!

Just import it inside of your MDX file and
use it like you would use it inside of a regular React JSX file.

<Card bg='MDXPGray5' sx={{mb: 3}}>

```md
import {Counter} from './counter.jsx'

# SLIDE 1
This is a slide, written in MDX

<Counter />

---
```

</Card>

<Card bg="white" sx={{width: '65%'}}>
<SlideInSlide>

# Slide 1
This is a slide, written in MDX

<Counter />

</SlideInSlide>
</Card>

</MDXPSideLayout>
