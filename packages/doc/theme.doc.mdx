# Theming
MDXP uses [Theme-UI][themeui] for styling, which allows you to modify any part of your presentation in a consistent manner, which ultimately results in having the same look and feel throughout your presentation.

A theme is just a plain old JavaScript object, with some properties that define your styles (`colors`, `fonts`, `fontSizes`, `space`, etc.) and some properties which apply those styles to your html and react components (`styles`).
We strongly recommend you to go through [Theme-UI][themeui]'s excellent documentation.


## Custom Theme
To enable the use of a custom theme, you can simply pass the object to your [Deck](/core-components#deck).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Deck from '@mdxp/core';
import theme from './theme.js';
import MDXPresentation from './presentation.mdx';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Deck theme={theme}>
    <MDXPresentation />
  </Deck>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## MDXP Styles
There are a few properties on your theme object, which get interpreted specially by MDXP.

- `theme.googleFont`      : The contents of this property can be a URL or an array of URL's, and MDXP will add the appropriate `<link />` tags to fetch the fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- `theme.mdxp.slide`      : This style variant gets applied to the `<Slide />` object that surrounds each of your slides. You can use it to set a default Typography for your presentation.
- `theme.mdxp.note`       : This style variant gets applied to the `<Note />` object that surrounds your presenter notes. You can use it to modify the look of your notes.
- `theme.mdxp.presenter`  : This style variant gets applied to the presenter components. You can use this to change the styling of the buttons and timer of the presenter mode.
- `theme.mdxp.block.*`    : You can create custom variants in this object and use them with the `variant` property of the [Block](/components-components#block) component.
- `theme.mdxp.flex.*`     : You can create custom variants in this object and use them with the `variant` property of the [Flex](/components-components#flex) component.
- `theme.mdxp.grid.*`     : You can create custom variants in this object and use them with the `variant` property of the [Grid](/components-components#grid) component.
- `theme.mdxp.styling.*`  : You can create custom variants in this object and use them with the `variant` property of the [Styling](/components-components#styling) component.


## Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting is not enabled by default, however it is quite easy to add it to your theme by using the [prism](https://theme-ui.com/packages/prism/) package from theme-ui.
