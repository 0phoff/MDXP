# Wrapper Components
This page contains the documentation for all Wrapper Components that the `@mdxp/components` package has to offer.

---


## ThemeWrapper
This component wraps each slide in a `<ThemeProvider />` component, allowing you to make modifications to the global theme.
Check out [Nested ThemeProviders](https://theme-ui.com/guides/nested-theme-providers) for more information.

### Properties
<Arguments of={ThemeWrapper} />

### Examples
```md
<ThemeWrapper theme={{colors: {background: 'tomato'}}}>

# SLIDE 1
This slide will have a tomato colored background

I am not sure if it is aesthetically pleasing, but it doesn't have to be.
After all, this is just a silly example

---

# SLIDE 2
it will also have this tomato background.  
Are you seriously still reading this ?

</ThemeWrapper>

# SLIDE 3
This one will have the default colored background, as it is outside the wrapper

Note that wrappers automatically end a slide, so there is no need for ---, but it doesn't hurt either.
```

---


## InvertWrapper
This component inverses the `text` and `background` color properties of your theme.

### Properties
<Arguments of={InvertWrapper} />

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1
This is a normal slide, with your default theme applied

---

<InvertWrapper>

# SLIDE 2
This slide will be inverted!  
Note that you __CANNOT__ ommit the --- after Slide 1, because those mark the end of that slide!

--- 

# SLIDE 3
This slide will still be inverted

---

</InvertWrapper>

# SLIDE 4
This slide is normal again.  
Note that you __CAN__ ommit the --- after Slide 3, because stopping the wrapper does terminate the slide as well.
You can however still add it, as is shown here.
```

---


## LayoutWrapper
This component changes the default layout for all slides inside of it.

### Properties
<Arguments of={LayoutWrapper} />

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1
This slide has the default layout, as provided in your Deck

---

<LayoutWrapper Layout={HeaderLayout}>

# SLIDE 2
This slide will have the HeaderLayout applied

---

<BlankLayout>

# SLIDE 3
This slide already has a BlankLayout, thus it will not be wrapped in the HeaderLayout.

</BlankLayout>

</LayoutWrapper>


```
