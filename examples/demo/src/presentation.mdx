# Stepping

<Step offset={0}>

With MDXP, stepping through your slide becomes a breeze.

Just wrap your content in a `<Step />` component and voila!

<Step>

- You can even _nest_ step components
- This is nice, because if the step component only has one child
- like in this example it only has a `<ul />`
- Then it will step through it's children automatically!

</Step>

# Math

Lift ($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation. :+1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L &= \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L \\
E &= mc^2
\end{aligned}
$$
