JavaScript.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Of course, you still need to transpile this JSX to valid JavaScript, in order for the browser to understand your code.\nThis is where `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://babeljs.io/\"\n      }}>{`Babel`}</a>{` comes into play. Babel is a JavaScript transpiler, which allows you to write next-generation JavaScript, with all the new features, and convert it to browser-compatible JavaScript code.\nBabel can also read JSX and transpile it to valid JavaScript, which is the main reason we use it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can now transpile a JSX file to browser-compatible JavaScript, but what if you want to split your code into multiple files and modules ?\nThis is the task of a bundler, like `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://webpack.js.org/\"\n      }}>{`Webpack`}</a>{`.\nWhile bundlers used to only combine different JavaScript files into one minified file, which you could then include in your HTML page, they have since evolved and are now able to do much more!\nWith Webpack, you can include any file format, as long as you provide a way to process those files to your end bundle.\nThis allows us to import images and videos, and Webpack will process those files according to our pipeline.\nFor videos, we just copy the file to the destination folder (in fact we do this for any file format that we do not know), but if images are small enough, we instead store them as raw data inside our javascript bundle, which means there is no need to copy the images along with your presentation.\nFeel free to look inside your `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`webpack.config.js`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`webpack.onepage.js`}</inlineCode>{` files, if you build your presentation with our template.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, Webpack also allows us to setup a pipeline for processing MDX files.\nMDX is a file format which enhances markdown, by allowing you to import and use React components inside of it.\nThis works, because the MDX transpiler transforms your MDX code into JSX, which is then transpiled into JavaScript with Babel.\nThe cool thing about the MDX transpiler is that it is build with the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://unifiedjs.com/\"\n      }}>{`Unified`}</a>{` toolset.\nThis allows us to extend the transpiler and add our own features to the MDX format.  `}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"how-is-this-different-from-mdx-deck\"\n    }}>{`How is this different from MDX-Deck`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I started using `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck\"\n      }}>{`MDX-Deck`}</a>{` and immediately loved the concept of writing your presentations with MDX.`}<br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`However, I found one big flaw with it and that is that it builds your presentation as a Gatsby website.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I have two reasons for disliking this:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`When presenting at conferences, you are sometimes obliged to present on a given computer and thus it is not feasible to present with a local server on your computer. While you could host your presentation somewhere and just browse to it, that has the downside that you are at the mercy of internet speeds at the conference, which might be a serious issue if you have lots of images and/or videos. The best solution would be to have a single file, like a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`.ppt`}</inlineCode>{`, that you can just open on any computer. MDXP allows to build your presentation in `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`onepage`}</inlineCode>{` mode, which means you end up with one `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`index.html`}</inlineCode>{` file (+ any videos or huge images), which you can open in any (modern) browser, without the need for a server.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`The fact that it uses Gatsby adds a whole layer of complexity. Gatsby is not a small tool and learning to use it takes some time. This also means that the threshold for someone being able to contribute to the project becomes much higher. The core of MDXP is just a react library and thus it is easier to learn and contribute to this repository. If need be, you can still integrate MDXP into a Gatsby project, thus having the best of both worlds.`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`I would like to express my gratitude towards the MDX-Deck project and the team behind it!`}<br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`I took a lot of inspiration and even some code from it, and would not have been able to build MDXP without it.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"contributing\"\n    }}>{`Contributing`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This project is setup as a monorepo with lerna and yarn workspaces.`}<br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`After installing `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://yarnpkg.com/\"\n      }}>{`yarn`}</a>{`, you can clone this repository and run the following commands to set everything up and start developing:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-bash\"\n      }}>{`yarn install\nlerna bootstrap\n`}</code></pre>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
