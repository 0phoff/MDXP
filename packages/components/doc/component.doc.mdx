# Components
This page contains the documentation for all regular Components that the `@mdxp/components` package has to offer.

---


## Block
This component will suround it's children with an element, which you can style with theme-aware properties.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Block} />

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1

<Block width='50%' bg='accent'>

This block will take 50% of the slide's width and have a background color set to the theme accent color.

Blocks can obviously contain multiple elements and by default group them in a div.
This component is quite handy in conjunction with columns.

</Block>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Block as="h2" sx={{color: 'red'}}>

Alternatively, you can pass your styles through an sx object property.
There is no difference between both methods and all properties get merged shallowly, using the object spread syntax.

Here the surrounding element will be an h2 tag.  
You can also pass custom components, but beware that you need to put them in between braces instead of quotes : {Component}

</Block>

```

---


## Columns
This component turns each of his children into a separate column.
You can set different styling options for the columns, by passing them as properties to this component.
If you pass an array as a property, each column will get a separate value.  
Internally, this component is implemented as a surrounding div with the following style:
```js
{
  width: '100%',
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  justifyContent: 'space-around',
  alignItems: 'center'
}
```

### Properties
<Arguments of={Columns} />

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1

<Columns>

1. This slide will have 2 columns
2. The first one with this numbered list

- And the second column will contain this list
- Which consists of bullet points

</Columns>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Columns width={['20%','50%','20%']} textAlign="center">

This slide has three columns, each with different widths.

The second column is wider.
Because `textAlign` is not an array, it gets applied to each column.

The third column is smaller again.
Note that the remaining 10% of width gets used as whitespace, depending on the justify-content parent property.
If any child has a flex-grow property, it will grow to fill those last 10%,
but you can read up on `flex` if you want to better understand this.

</Columns>
```

---


## Place
This component allows you to absolutely position an element in your slide, effectively taking it outside of the flow of the other elements.  
If you do pass neither _left_, nor _right_ properties, the element will be centered horizontally and similarly for _top_ and _bottom_.
Centering happens, by adding a `transform: translate()` CSS property, so beware if you pass your own transform property through _sx_.

> __NOTE__  
> This component surround its elements with a div, and it is that div that gets placed.  
> If you use this component to center eg. an image, it is thus important to set your desired width on this element,
> and set the width of the image to 100%.
> Otherwise the image will not look centered, as it is the surrounding div that is centered and not the image.

### Properties
<Arguments of={Place} />

### Example
```md
# SLIDE 1
This paragraph is in the normal flow of the slide

<Place bottom="10px">

This paragraph gets placed in the bottom center.

</Place>

- This list is placed under the first paragraph
- Just like if the second paragraph was never there

---

# SLIDE 2
The image below gets placed in the center of the slide and takes 50% of the slide width.

<Place sx={{width: '50%'}}>

![image&&width=100%](./path/to/image.png)

</Place>
```

---


## Styling
This component applies any property you pass as a custom style to its child.
It applies the styles using the _sx_ property and thus allows the use of theme values.

> __NOTE__  
> This component only allows to have a single child element!

### Properties
<Arguments>
{{
  name: 'sx',
  type: 'object',
  desc: 'You can style the element by giving an sx property. This is set as a Theme-UI sx property and can thus accept theme aware values.'
}}
{{
  name: 'children',
  type: 'element',
  desc: 'Single child that gets styled according to the sx property.'
}}
{{
  name: 'props',
  type: 'object',
  required: false,
  desc: 'Alternatively, you can also apply styles by adding them as properties straight away.',
}}
</Arguments>

### Examples
```md
# SLIDE 1

<Styling bg="accent" color="black" width="100%" paddingLeft="25px">

- This list has a background color set to your theme's accent color
- The foreground color is set to black
- We also set a width and paddingLeft property.

</Styling>

---

# SLIDE 2

<Styling sx={{variant: text.emphasis}}>

You can also specify your styles using a more classical approach of defining an `sx` property.
Styles defined using sx and as regular properties get merged together in a shallow manner (object spread syntax).  
Here we used the styling tag to style this paragraph with a custom defined `text.emphasis` variant.

</Styling>
```
