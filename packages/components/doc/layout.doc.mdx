# Layout Components
This page contains the documentation for all Layout Components that the `@mdxp/components` package has to offer.

---


## BlankLayout
This is the default layout for MDXP, which is exposed here if you need to explicitely use it.  
This layout is setup as a div with the following default `sx` style:

```js
sx = {
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',
  boxSizing: 'border-box',
  position: 'relative',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'column',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  color: 'text',
  bg: 'background',
  '& p': {textAlign: 'center'},
}
```

### Properties
<Arguments of={BlankLayout} />

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1
This slide will use whathever the default layout is as its layout

---

<BlankLayout>

# SLIDE 2
This slide wil have a blank layout.

</BlankLayout>

---

<BlankLayout sx={{color: 'tomato'}}>

# SLIDE 3
This slide will have a blank layout with a tomato colored text.

</BlankLayout>

---

<BlankLayout sx={{bg: 'primary'}}>

# SLIDE 4
This slide will have a blank layout with your theme's "primary" color as background.

</BlankLayout>

```

---


## HeaderLayout
This layout looks at its first child and if that is an H1-H6 element, places it at the top.
You can also pass an optional `Footer` element as a property, which will be set at the bottom.
The rest of the page will be filled with a div that contains the rest of the slide and which is styled like a [BlankLayout](#blanklayout) by default.

### Properties
<Arguments of={HeaderLayout} />

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1
This slide will use whathever the default layout is as its layout

---

<HeaderLayout>

# SLIDE 2
This slide will have its title (SLIDE 2) at the top of the page

</HeaderLayout>

---

<HeaderLayout sxHeader={{width: '100%', bg: 'text', color: 'background', textAlign: 'center'}}>

### SLIDE 3
This slide will have its title at the top of the page,
in a full-width box with inverted background and foreground color.

Note that the title is smaller, because we used an H3 tag.

</HeaderLayout>

---

<HeaderLayout>

This slide 4 will look like a BlankLayout, because it does not have a title as first element.

</HeaderLayout>
```

---


## NumberLayout
This layout renders a [BlankLayout](#blanklayout), but places an extra, absolutely posistioned, element which contains the current slide number.
The extra element is rendered with a [Place](./components-components#place) component.

### Properties
<Arguments of={NumberLayout} />

### Examples
```mdxp
# SLIDE 1
This slide will use whathever the default layout is as its layout

---

<NumberLayout>

# SLIDE 2
This slide will have the number 1 written in the bottom right corner.

</NumberLayout>

---

<NumberLayout offset={1} numberOptions={{bottom: '25px', left: '25px', sx: {color: 'red', fontSize: '50px'}}}>

# SLIDE 3
This slide will have the number 3 written in the bottom left corner.  
The number will also be red and have a 50px font-size.

</NumberLayout>
```
