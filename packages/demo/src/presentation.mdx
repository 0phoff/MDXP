<DummyLayout sx={{bg: 'salmon'}}>

  # Testing custom Layouts
  
  1. We should only see one red banner
  2. This is because our custom layout has overwritten the default one (we just happen to use the same layout)
  2. We changed the background color of our layout to salmon, to show we do in fact use this new layout

</DummyLayout>
